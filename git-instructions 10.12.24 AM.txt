Bioconductor instructions

all changes should be pushed from the devel branch

## pull latest version from Bioconductor
# this will give the latest devel version, which is the latest 
# release also if labelled with a .0 

# prior to doing this move all uncommitted stuff to /devel
fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master

# then build and check
