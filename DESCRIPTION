Description: A differential abundance analysis for the comparison of two or more
    conditions. Useful for analyzing data from standard RNA-seq or meta-RNA-seq assays
    as well as selected and unselected values from in-vitro sequence selections.
    Uses a Dirichlet-multinomial model to infer abundance from counts, optimized for
    three or more experimental replicates. The method infers biological and sampling
    variation to calculate the expected false discovery rate, given the variation, based
    on a Wilcox rank test or Welch t-test (via aldex.ttest), or a glm and Kruskal-Wallis
    test (via aldex.glm). Reports p-values and Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values.
