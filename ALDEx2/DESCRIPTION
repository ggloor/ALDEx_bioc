Description: A differential abundance analysis for the comparison of two or more 
    conditions. For example, single-organism and meta-RNA-seq high-throughput 
    sequencing assays, or of selected and unselected values from in-vitro
    sequence selections. Uses a Dirichlet-multinomial model to infer abundance 
    from counts, that has been optimized for three or more experimental 
    replicates. Infers sampling variation and calculates the expected false 
    discovery rate given the biological and sampling variation using the Wilcox 
    rank test or Welches t-test (aldex.ttest) or the glm and Kruskal Wallis 
    tests (aldex.glm). Reports both P and fdr values calculated by the 
    Benjamini Hochberg correction.
