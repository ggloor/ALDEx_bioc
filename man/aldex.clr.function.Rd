\title{Compute an \code{aldex.clr} Object
Generate Monte Carlo samples of the Dirichlet distribution for each sample.
Convert each instance using a log-ratio transform.
This is the input for all further analyses.}
\usage{
aldex.clr.function(
  reads,
  conds,
  mc.samples = 128,
  denom = "all",
  verbose = FALSE,
  useMC = FALSE,
  summarizedExperiment = NULL,
  gamma = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{reads}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{RangedSummarizedExperiment} object containing
non-negative integers only and with unique names for all rows and columns,
where each row is a different gene and each column represents a sequencing
read-count sample. Rows with 0 reads in each sample are deleted prior to
analysis.}

\item{conds}{A \code{vector} containing a descriptor for the samples, allowing them to
be grouped and compared.}

\item{mc.samples}{The number of Monte Carlo instances to use to estimate the underlying
distributions; since we are estimating central tendencies, 128 is usually
sufficient, but larger numbers may be needed with small sample sizes.}

\item{denom}{An \code{any} variable (all, iqlr, zero, lvha, median, user) indicating
features to use as the denominator for the Geometric Mean calculation
The default "all" uses the geometric mean abundance of all features.
Using "median" returns the median abundance of all features.
Using "iqlr" uses the features that are between the first and third
quartile of the variance of the clr values across all samples.
Using "zero" uses the non-zero features in each grop
as the denominator. This approach is an extreme case where there are
many nonzero features in one condition but many zeros in another. Using
"lvha" uses features that have low variance (bottom quartile) and high
relative abundance (top quartile in every sample). It is also
possible to supply a vector of row indices to use as the denominator.
Here, the experimentalist is determining a-priori which rows are thought
to be invariant. In the case of RNA-seq, this could include ribosomal
protein genes and and other house-keeping genes. This should be used
with caution because the offsets may be different in the original data
and in the data used by the function because features that are 0 in all
samples are removed by \code{aldex.clr}.}

\item{verbose}{Print diagnostic information while running. Useful only for debugging
if fails on large datasets.}

\item{useMC}{Use multicore by default (FALSE). Multi core processing will be attempted
with the BiocParallel package. Serial processing will be used if this is
not possible. In practice serial and multicore are nearly the same speed
because of overhead in setting up the parallel processes.}

\item{summarizedExperiment}{must be set to TRUE if input data are in this format.}

\item{gamma}{Use scale simulation if not NULL. If a matrix is supplied, scale simulation
will be used assuming that matrix denotes the scale samples. If a numeric is
supplied, scale simulation will be applied by relaxing the geometric mean
assumption with the numeric representing the standard deviation of the
scale distribution.}

\value{
The object produced by the \code{clr} function contains the log-ratio transformed
values for each Monte-Carlo Dirichlet instance, which can be accessed through
\code{getMonteCarloInstances(x)}, where \code{x} is the \code{clr} function output.
Each list element is named by the sample ID. \code{getFeatures(x)} returns the
features, \code{getSampleIDs(x)} returns sample IDs, and \code{getFeatureNames(x)}
returns the feature names.

   # The 'reads' data.frame or
   # RangedSummarizedExperiment object should
   # have row and column names that are unique,
   # and looks like the following:
   #
   #              T1a T1b  T2  T3  N1  N2  Nx
   #   Gene_00001   0   0   2   0   0   1   0
   #   Gene_00002  20   8  12   5  19  26  14
   #   Gene_00003   3   0   2   0   0   0   1
   #       ... many more rows ...

   data(selex)

   conds <- c(rep("NS", 7), rep("S", 7))
